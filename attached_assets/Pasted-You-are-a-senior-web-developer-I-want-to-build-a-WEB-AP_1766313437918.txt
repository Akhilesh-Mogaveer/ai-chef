You are a senior web developer.

I want to build a WEB APPLICATION (browser-based website only).
This is NOT a mobile app, NOT Android, NOT iOS.

Project Name:
Campus Connect

Project Type:
Web application (runs in a browser using localhost or deployed via GitHub-based workflows)

Purpose:
Students can report campus issues, and staff/admin can manage and resolve them.

Tech Stack (WEB ONLY):
- React
- Next.js (Pages Router, not App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Firebase (ONLY as backend: Authentication + Firestore)
- No Firebase Hosting
- The website should run using:
  - npm install
  - npm run dev
  - browser URL (localhost)

User Roles:
1. Student
2. Staff
3. Admin

Authentication:
- Firebase Email/Password authentication
- Web-based login form
- No mobile SDKs

Pages Required (VERY IMPORTANT):

1. Home Page (/)
   - Project introduction
   - Login / Register buttons

2. Login Page (/login)
   - Email & password login
   - Redirect based on role

3. Student Dashboard (/dashboard/student)
   - Create a new issue
   - View own reported issues
   - Track issue status

4. Staff Dashboard (/dashboard/staff)
   - View assigned issues
   - Update issue status (In Progress, Resolved)

5. Admin Dashboard (/dashboard/admin)
   - View all issues
   - Assign issues to staff
   - Change issue priority
   - View analytics summary

6. Analytics Page (/dashboard/analytics)
   - Issue count by category
   - Status overview
   - Simple charts (optional)

Core Features:
- Issue reporting (title, description, category, priority)
- Role-based dashboards
- Real-time issue updates using Firestore
- Secure Firestore rules
- Proper auth-state handling before querying Firestore
- Clean UI tables for issues
- Date handling using standard JavaScript Date or date-fns

Rules:
- DO NOT generate mobile code
- DO NOT use React Native, Expo, or Capacitor
- DO NOT include Firebase Hosting
- DO NOT assume deployment to Play Store or App Store
- Code must be runnable directly from GitHub

Expected Output:
- Complete folder structure
- Page components
- Firestore data models
- Example Firestore queries
- Explanation of each major feature
- Web-only implementation

Goal:
A clean, functional, browser-based website suitable for a college project and GitHub submission.
